This section of the document is plain markdown. I'm adding *italics* and **boldface** text in the same way I would in any other markdown document.

- I am adding a list
- in the same way also

In the next section I am going to add a "chunk" of R code:

```{r}
print("hello world!")
```

You can see that (by default) the "knitted" document shows my code first, which is then followed by the output that R generates when this code is "executed".
